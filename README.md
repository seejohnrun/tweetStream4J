# TweetStream4J

*This is a Java binding for the Twitter API written in a way that will allow Java developers to quickly and successfully work with the Twitter API.*  
*It is in complete working order, but there are some definite issues as it is only one day old.  See the Issues tab for more info*

---

### Example 1:

    TwitterStreamConfiguraion tws = new TwitterStreamConfiguration("username", "password");
    MyTwitterHandler handler = new MyTwitterHandler();

    TwitterStream ts = TweetRiver.sample(tws, handler);
    (new Thread(ts)).start();

### Example 2:

    TwitterStreamConfiguration tws = new TwitterStreamConfiguration("username", "password");
    MyTwitterHandler handler = new MyTwitterHandler();

    Collection<String> tracks = new ArrayList<String>();
    tracks.add("twitter");
    TwitterStream ts = TweetRiver.filter(tws, handler, null, tracks);
    (new Thread(ts)).start();

### TwitterStreamHandler(s)

similarly simple:

    class MyTwitterHandler implements TwitterStreamHandler {

        public void addTweet(STweet t) {
            System.out.println("TWEET! " + t.toString());
        }

        public void addLimit(STweet l) {
            System.out.println("LIMIT! " + l.toString());
        }

        public void addDeletion(SDeletion d) {
            System.out.println("DELETION! " + d.toString());
        }
        
        public void stop() {
            System.out.println("Stopped.");
        }

    }

### Maven json-lib dependency 

for some reason json lib artifacts are deployed prefixed with the jdk version they're compatilble with, which makes the build fail  
here is a work-around to install it into your local repo:

* curl -O http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/sf/json-lib/json-lib/2.2.3/json-lib-2.2.3-jdk15.jar
  
* mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=net.sf.json-lib -DartifactId=json-lib -Dversion=2.2.3 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=json-lib-2.2.3-jdk15.jar
    rm json-lib-2.2.3-jdk15.jar
