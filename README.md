# TweetStream4J

*This is a Java binding for the Twitter API written in a way that will allow Java developers to quickly and successfully work with the Twitter API.*  
__Uses OAuth authentication__.

---

### Example 1:

    TwitterStreamConfiguration tws = new TwitterStreamConfiguration(KEY, SECRET);
    tws.getAuthorizationUrl(); // URL to visit for PIN
    tws.authorize(pin); // enter the pin from the site
    tws.getToken(); tws.getTokenSecret(); // hold onto these

    MyTwitterHandler handler = new MyTwitterHandler();    

    TwitterStream ts = TweetRiver.sample(tws, handler);
    (new Thread(ts)).start();

### Example 2:

    Collection<String> tracks = new ArrayList<String>();
    tracks.add("twitter");
    TwitterStream ts = TweetRiver.filter(tws, handler, null, tracks);
    (new Thread(ts)).start();

### TwitterStreamHandler(s)

similarly simple:

    class MyTwitterHandler implements TwitterStreamHandler {

        public void addTweet(STweet t) {
            System.out.println("TWEET! " + t.toString());
        }

        public void addLimit(STweet l) {
            System.out.println("LIMIT! " + l.toString());
        }

        public void addDeletion(SDeletion d) {
            System.out.println("DELETION! " + d.toString());
        }
        
        public void stop() {
            System.out.println("Stopped.");
        }

    }
